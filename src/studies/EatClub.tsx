    about: ["A brand new digital ecosystem including multiple websites and customer facing online services."],
    brief: ["The brief was to redesign the entire aesthetic of the app and properly review the user’s experience to keep it up to date maximise the potential of users returning and keep using the app. I set out to simplify the UI and user case processes by supporting it with evidence obtained from reviewing current trends and successful competitors apps, listening to customer feedback and insight from analytics."],
    background: [
        "In 2019 Port Phillip Council’s digital heart was in need of a major upgrade. 53% of customers reported that they were unable to find what they were searching for, or that they required further information following their visit to the website.",
        "At the same time, legacy systems and platforms were impacting efficiency, meaning Council's digital ecosystem required much more than a new lick of paint.",
        "“The current, clunky system is well and truly past its use-by date. The ageing technology is not meeting the growing demand and expectations from people accessing our websites for everything from requesting services to applying for permits.” - Mayor Gross, City of Port Phillip",
        "VERSA was awarded a ten year contract to support Port Phillip's digital transformation, leading the redesign and development of a new technical ecosystem.",
    ],
    challenge: ["Establish a centralised digital platform for service delivery and engagement that will support the city’s evolution towards a digital-first future."],
    credits: ["Trainer photography by Jeremy Simons", "Back-end development by PixelForce"],
    deliverables: ["App UI design (Both iOS and Android platforms)", "Responsive website design", "Email marketing campaigns", "Editing and exporting of 1000+ Workout videos", "Physical products and apparel", "Signage for launch campaign"],

    information: "The Sweat app can be downloaded from the Apple Store here and the Google Play Store here The Sweat website can be viewed here The Sweat Facebook page can be viewed here",
    objective: ["As users begin to embrace this new wave of design and cultural aesthetic, brands must adapt.", "As well as trying to enhance the overall user experience, there are goals we’re trying to achieve and problems we want to rectify. We want the purpose of the app to be clear and a simple process for a new user and a seamless experience for an existing user. Which is helping the user find a deal that appeals to them at a restaurant nearby and getting them to redeem the voucher within a minute or two. If this is a enjoyable, memorable experience for them in which they can not only see the value on their bank balance and return to use the app again, than the redesign is considered a success.", "From an aesthetic point of view, maintaining the integrity of the brand and visual direction put forth by SouthSouthWest is also imperative."],
    recognitions: ["2016 Apple Watch App of the Year"],
    results: "I played the principal role of successfully leading the design team whilst forming strong relations with the engineer developers to collaboratively produce the product. Very tight deadlines were needed to be met in an lean working environment, to allow for quick yet high quality succession of results. The general style would change significantly given the rebrand as we moved from one singular trainer to a more encompassing, marketable brand which would house numerous trainers and workout types. This style is evidently more cleaner and minimalistic, allowing it to be characterised by the trainers and the personality of their training styles.",
    slogan: "For the everyday Member, BankVic's existing website was confusing and complex.",
    summary: "EatClub hopes to enhance the vibrancy of the food culture in every city it operates in. By showing customers where restaurants are nearby with spare tables that offer last minute deals.",
