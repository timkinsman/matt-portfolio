        "Our team took insights from user research to create an audience-focused navigation and design. This included structuring the delivery of learning modules by user persona, allowing each different user group to easily make their way through the program in bite-sized modules, at a pace that best suits their busy schedules.",
        "To avoid attrition and encourage ongoing engagement, simple gamification techniques and notifications are used to motivate users to explore further and complete the entire course.",
        "Be You and Salesforce are completely interoperable, with all user information captured upon registration being sent to Salesforce, which is in turn utilised for the provision of learning resources, school information, complex user group management, and user notifications."
