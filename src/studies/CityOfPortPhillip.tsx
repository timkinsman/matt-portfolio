    brief: "The Sweat app is the next evolutionary step from the Sweat with Kayla brand, which solely featured Kayla Itsines as the main trainer and face of the brand. As the brand transitioned to simply just 'Sweat', two new additional trainers were brought on board by the names of Kelsey Wells and Sjana Elise to provide their own expertise and knowledge by introducing their unique training methods and style. By bringing in a post-pregnancy (SELF) and yoga program (BAM) it would allow for a more inclusive product, facilitating many more women around the world increasing its target demographic and reach.",
    objective: "I played the principal role of successfully leading the design team whilst forming strong relations with the engineer developers to collaboratively produce the product. Very tight deadlines were needed to be met in an lean working environment, to allow for quick yet high quality succession of results. The general style would change significantly given the rebrand as we moved from one singular trainer to a more encompassing, marketable brand which would house numerous trainers and workout types. This style is evidently more cleaner and minimalistic, allowing it to be characterised by the trainers and the personality of their training styles.",
